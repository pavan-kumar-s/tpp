# Reviewer 6bMr: 
We thank the reviewer for the useful comments. We will revise the manuscript that incorporates all reviewers’ comments while submitting for Camera-ready papers

**Weakness-1:**
Benchmarks are not multi-document QA. HotpotQA, 2WikiMQA and MuSiQue require reasoning across paragraphs drawn from Wikipedia, but all evidence ultimately resides in one monolithic source. To claim multi-document QA the system should be evaluated on datasets where answers require synthesising separate primary documents. For example, FanOutQA, WikiHowQA, Narrative QA, MultiDoc2Dial, VisDoMBench, etc.


We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We agree that datasets such as FanOutQA and MultiDoc2Dial better reflect scenarios where answers must be synthesized from truly distinct primary documents. In our work, we followed the terminology used in prior literature [1–3], where HotpotQA, 2WikiMQA, and MuSiQue have been widely referred to as multi-document QA benchmarks, primarily due to their requirement for reasoning across multiple passages, albeit sourced from a single repository like Wikipedia. We will clarify this distinction more explicitly in the revised version to avoid any potential confusion.

Results are compared only with multi-hop-within-corpus retrievers (HippoRAG-2, KAG, etc.). Standard multi-document QA baselines are absent, such as Visconde, KGP, KGP’s variant (e.g., Curiousllm), etc.

**Weakness-2:**
Evaluation run on small 1000 subsets rather than full test sets.


Related work lacks multi-doc related and efficient RAG related research.


While the paper claims lower LLM cost, there is no concrete token / dollar comparison against iterative baselines.


BrowseNet extends earlier KG-enhanced RAGs (GraphRAG, HippoRAG) mainly with query-specific traversal, which limits its novelty.
