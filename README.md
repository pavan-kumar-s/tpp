**Weakness-1:**<br>
Thank you for your insightful comment on the need for a more formalized definition for weight assignment. We will now include a precise mathematical formulation. 
For a subgraph query, **$QG \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$** with query nodes sorted in topological order, ($V_{q,1}$, $V_{q,2}$, $\cdots$, $V_{q,k}$), the weighted similarity of the retrieved subgraph, **$SG$** = ($V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, $\cdots$, $V_{k}$) is given by,
<br> <br> $weight_{SG} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{similarity(V_{q,1}, V_1)}{i}$ <br>
Here, the similarity score is the cosine similarity between the embedding of the query node, $V_{q,i}$, and the embedding of the knowledge graph node, $V_{i}$. This weighted score for a subgraph ensures that more weightage is given to predecessor nodes in the topological order. By prioritizing earlier nodes, the approach captures the hierarchical influence within the query structure.
